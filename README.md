## ChatBot

The scope of this project is to create a different type of interaction
<br> with your network when you need basic information.  
<br> The ChatBot is for the Slack app and it is written using Python and  Slack API's.
<br> It has 2 parts: the Slack app configuration and the Python scripts that live on your server.
<br> Here on Github you will find the Python part of the project.

## Usage

The project is made of multiple python scripts:
<br> - app.py this is the main app where all other python scripts/functions are used
<br> - all other scripts are functions/commands that the Chatbot can perform, and they are:
<br>   hello , help, inventory , interfaces status <device>, interfaces down, wifi clients, PiTemp, myip
